                            <p>If a game is canceled, postponed, or rescheduled to a time outside of the original Scoring Period, the game will be disabled from the Game Set and players listed to play in that game will not be eligible to accrue points.

                            <p className='__mt-2 __mb-2'>Any games that are disabled will be indicated as such on the Power Center page. Emails and other notifications may also be used to notify users of disabled games.</p>
